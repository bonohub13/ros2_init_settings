  make sure to comment out `source /opt/ros/<YOUR_VERSION_OF_ROS>/setup.bash` so it doesn't mix up!

###### NOTICE: There have been some mistakes in ros2_settings.bash, and ros2_env_init_settings.bash!

(SORRY, I just can't!)  
If you can, please leave a notice what packages you needed.  
And if you did, thanks...
